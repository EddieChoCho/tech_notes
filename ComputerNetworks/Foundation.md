## Applications

### Application Protocol
* URL: Uniform resource locater
* HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
* TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
* 17 messages for one URL request
    * 6 to find the IP (Internet Protocol) address
    * 3 for connection establishment of TCP
    * 4 for HTTP request and acknowledgement
        * Request: I got your request and I will send the data
        * Reply: Here is the data you requested; I got the data
    * 4 messages for tearing down TCP connection

## Network Connectivity
* Important terminologies
    * Link
    * Nodes
    * Point-to-point
    * Multiple access
    * Switched Network
    * Circuit Switched
    * Packet Switched
    * Packet, message
    * Store-and-forward
    * Hosts
    * Switches
    * Spanning tree
    * internetwork
    * Router/gateway
    * Host-to-host connectivity
    * Address
    * Routing
    * Unicast/broadcast/multicast
    * LAN (Local Area Networks)
    * MAN (Metropolitan Area Networks)
    * WAN (Wide Area Networks)

### How datagrams are delivered in an Internet?

#### Cost-Effective Resource Sharing
* Resource: links and nodes
    * How to share a link?
        * `Multiplexing`
            * Multiplexing multiple logical flows over a single physical link
        * `De-multiplexing`
* `FDM: Frequency Division Multiplexing`
* `Synchronous Time-division Multiplexing (TDM)`
    * Time slots/data transmitted in predetermined slots

* `Statistical Multiplexing`
    * Data is transmitted based on demand of each flow.
    * What is a `flow`?
    * Packets vs. Messages
    * FIFO, Round-Robin, Priorities (Quality-of-Service (QoS))
    * Congested ?
    
    * A switch multiplexing packets from multiple sources onto one shared link

#### Logical Channels
* Logical Channels: Application-to-Application communication path or a pipe

#### Network Reliability
* Network should `hide the errors`
* Bits are lost
    * Bit errors (1 to a 0, and vice versa)
    * Burst errors â€“ several consecutive errors
* Packets are lost (Congestion)
* Links and Node failures
* Messages are delayed
* Messages are delivered out-of-order
* Third parties eavesdrop
