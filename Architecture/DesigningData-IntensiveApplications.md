# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## Ch1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
* Many applications need to:
	* Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases)
	* Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)
	* Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes)
	* Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream pro‚Äêcessing)
	* Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing)

* In this book, we focus on three concerns that are important in most software systems: Reliability, Scalability, and Maintainability

### Reliability

* The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance)
  even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human error).

### Scalability

* As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with
  that growth.

### Maintainability

* Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current
  behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.

## Ch6.

* Replication: having multiple copies of the same data on different nodes.
* For very large datasets, or very high query throughput, that is not sufficient: we need to break the data up into
  partitions, also known as sharding.
* The main reason for wanting to partition data is scalability.
* Different partitions can be placed on different nodes in a shared-nothing cluster. Thus, a large dataset can be
  distributed across many disks, and the query load can be distributed across many processors.
* For queries that operate on a single partition, each node can independently execute the queries for its own partition,
  so query throughput can be scaled by adding more nodes.
* Large, complex queries can potentially be parallelized across many nodes, although this gets significantly harder.

## Partitioning and Replication

* Partitioning is usually combined with replication so that copies of each partition are stored on multiple nodes (for
  fault tolerance).

### Partitioning and Secondary Indexes - How the indexing of data interacts with partitioning.

### Rebalancing Partitions - which is necessary if you want to add or remove nodes in your cluster

### Request Routing -
