## Publisher Confirms and Returns

* Set `publisherConfirmType` property of CachingConnectionFactory to `ConfirmType.CORRELATED`.
* Obtained a channel instances created by the factory are wrapped in an PublisherCallbackChannel, which is used to
  facilitate the callbacks.
* Register a PublisherCallbackChannel.Listener with the Channel. (The PublisherCallbackChannel implementation contains
  logic to route a "confirm" or return to the appropriate listener.)

### Publishing is Asynchronous - How to Detect Successes and Failures

* Publishing messages is an asynchronous mechanism and, by default, messages that cannot be routed are dropped by
  RabbitMQ.
* Consider two failure scenarios:
    * Publish to an exchange but there is no matching destination queue.
    * Publish to a non-existent exchange.

#### Publish to a non-existent exchange

* The message is dropped and no return is generated.
* The underlying channel is closed with an exception.
* By default, this exception is logged, but you can register a ChannelListener with the CachingConnectionFactory to
  obtain notifications of such events.

```
this.connectionFactory.addConnectionListener(new ConnectionListener() {

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Connection connection) {
    }

    @Override
    public void onShutDown(ShutdownSignalException signal) {
        ...
    }

});
```

* You can examine the signalâ€™s reason property to determine the problem that occurred.
* To detect the exception on the sending thread, you can setChannelTransacted(true) on the RabbitTemplate and the
  exception is detected on the txCommit().
* However, `transactions significantly impede performance`, so consider this carefully before enabling transactions for
  just this one use case.

### Publish to an exchange but there is no matching destination queue

* The RabbitTemplate implementation of AmqpTemplate supports publisher confirms and returns
* For publisher confirms (also known as publisher acknowledgements), the template requires a CachingConnectionFactory
  that has its publisherConfirm property set to ConfirmType.CORRELATED.
* Confirms are sent to the client by it registering a RabbitTemplate.ConfirmCallback by calling setConfirmCallback(
  ConfirmCallback callback).
    * Only one ConfirmCallback is supported by a RabbitTemplate.
* The callback must implement this
  method: ```void confirm(CorrelationData correlationData, boolean ack, String cause);```
    * correlationData: an object supplied by the client when sending the original message.
    * ack: true for an ack and false for a nack.
    * cause: for nack instances, the cause may contain a reason for the nack, if it is available when the nack is
      generated.
        * e.g., When sending a message to a non-existent exchange. In that case, the broker closes the channel. The
          reason for the closure is included in the cause.
