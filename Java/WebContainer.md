# Web Container(Servlet Container)

* A component of a web server that interacts with Jakarta Servlets which responsible for:
  * Managing the lifecycle of servlets
  * Mapping a URL to a particular servlet and ensuring that the URL requester has the correct access-rights.

* The Web container handles requests to servlets, Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) files, and other types of files that
  include server-side code.
* The Web container creates servlet instances, loads and unloads servlets, creates and manages request and response
  objects, and performs other servlet-management tasks.
* A web container implements the web component contract of the Jakarta EE architecture. This architecture specifies a
  runtime environment for additional web components, including security, concurrency, lifecycle management, transaction,
  deployment, and other services.
