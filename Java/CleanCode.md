# Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

## Chapter 4: Comments

* Comments are, at best, a necessary evil.
* If our programming languages were expressive enough, we would not need comments very much—perhaps not at all.
* Programmers can't realistically maintain comments.
    * Code changes and evolves. Chunks of it move from here to there. Those chunks bifurcate and reproduce and come
      together again to form chimeras. Unfortunately the comments don’t always follow them—can’t always follow them
    * It is possible to make the point that programmers should be disciplined enough to keep the comments in a high
      state of repair, relevance, and accuracy. I agree, they should. But I would rather that energy go toward making
      the code so clear and expressive that it does not need the comments in the first place.

* Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all. They delude and mislead.
* Code is the only source of truly accurate information, Only the code can truly tell you what it does. Therefore,
  though comments are sometimes necessary, we will expend significant energy to minimize them.
* Explain Yourself in Code
    * Reasonable names of method and variables
* Good Comments
    * Legal Comments
        * For example, copyright and authorship statements
    * Informative Comments
    * Explanation of Intent
    * Clarification
    * TODO Comments

* Bad Comments
