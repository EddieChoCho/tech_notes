### 2.Performance and Scaling
#### 2.1 Response time and throughput
##### Transaction response time
* The transaction response time is measured as the time it takes to complete a transaction.
* It encompasses the following time segments:
    * The database connection acquisition time 
    * The time it takes to send all database statements over the wire
    * The execution time for all incoming statements
    * The time it takes for sending the result sets back to the database client
    * The time the transaction is idle due to application-level computations prior to releasing the database connection.
    
##### Throughput
* Throughput is defined as the rate of completing incoming load. In a database context.
* Throughput can be calculated as the number of transactions executed within a given time interval.
* Throughput = transaction count / time

##### Response time and throughput
* Ideally, if the system was scaling linearly, adding more database connections would yield a proportional throughput increase. 
* Due to contention on database resources and the cost of maintaining coherency across multiple concurrent database sessions, the relative throughput gain follows a curve instead of a straight line.
* C(N) = N / 1 + α (N − 1) + βN (N − 1)
    * C - the relative throughput gain for the given concurrency level
    * α - the contention coefficient (the serializable portion of the data processing routine)
    * β - the coherency coefficient (the cost for maintaining consistency across all concurrent database sessions).
    * N - the number of concurrent sessions.
